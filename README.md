# 🔥 ToDos React.js App 🔥 
Welcome to my project! It's great to have you here. 😉 

Todos project for training on type script and how can I use it to reduce the errors and ensure what the props should send to component and the type of it Which in turn ensures that when you use a specific component, you must send the props you need, matching the correct data type for each props.
Thus reducing errors and facilitating dealing with components, as there is no longer a need for us to return to the component to remember what Probus wants, especially when we work on large projects or when the component was not created by me or was created a long time ago.

Skills: React.js, TypeScript and CSS
